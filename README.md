### **2\. Integrated Quiz Modes for Deep Mastery**

The app randomly selects questions from three modes to test different aspects of sign recognition and recall:

| **MCQ** (Video-to-Word) | Watch a video sign, select the correct word from 4 options. | Sign recognition | None |
| **Video Select** (Word-to-Video) | Read a word, select the correct signing video from 4 options. | Word recall/Visual association | None |
| **Type-In** (Video-to-Word) | Watch a video sign, type the correct word. | Active recall/Spelling | **Must be answered correctly in both MCQ and Video Select mode first.** |

### **3\. Review Queue**

Any word answered incorrectly is automatically added to a dedicated **Review Mode** queue, allowing the user to focus on their weak points.

### **4\. Aesthetic Design**

The user interface utilizes a modern **Material You Expressive** theme, featuring bold colors, rounded corners, and elevated elements for an engaging visual experience.

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository (or setup files):** Ensure you have the following files: server.py, index.html, app.js, and style.css.  
2. **Create Video Data:** Create a folder named Video Data in the same directory as server.py. Inside it, create subdirectories for each word (e.g., Video Data/apple, Video Data/banana) and place the corresponding video files within them.  
3. **Run the Server:** Open your terminal in the project directory and run:  
   python server.py

4. **Access the App:** The server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this address in your web browser.

## **üéÆ How to Play**

1. **Start Quiz:** The app automatically loads a random question in Level 1 (either **MCQ** or **Video Select**).  
2. **Answer:** Select the correct option or type in the word (in Type-In mode).  
3. **Progress:** Upon continuous correct answers, you will be served the same word across different modes. Once a word is mastered in all three modes, it is counted toward your level completion.  
4. **Advance Level:** When all words in the current level are fully mastered, the app automatically progresses you to the next level.  
5. **Review:** If you miss a sign, use the **Review Mode** button to cycle through your missed words.
